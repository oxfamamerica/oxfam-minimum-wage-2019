        The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 for ten years. In that 
        time, the cost of living has continued to climb, leaving millions of 
        families working harder than ever, but falling behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Raise the Wage Act of 2019 would gradually raise the wage to $15 by 
        2024. Nationwide, it would benefit nearly 40 million workers &ndash; 27 percent 
        of the workforce. Here&rsquo;s how it would benefit workers in <span class="js-districtName"></span>.

        A common misperception is that many minimum wage jobs are filled by teenagers 
        who add little to the family&rsquo;s income. The reality is that workers of

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Data by state:</strong> While the federal minimum wage has been 
              stuck at $7.25 since 2009, many states and cities have increased the 
              minimum wage. As the wage floor rises in an area, it lifts wages 
              for most workers.
            </p>
            <p>
              These differences are reflected in the numbers of workers who would 
              benefit from a raise to $15. For example, the minimum wage in California 
              is $11 in 2019, and is increasing to $15 by 2024; this means that 
              no workers would benefit from the raise in the federal minimum. (It 
              does not, obviously, mean that no workers are earning low wages.) 
              Some cities within California currently have a minimum of $15.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data on workers who benefit:</strong> &ldquo;Directly affected workers&rdquo; are 
            those who would otherwise be paid less than $15 in 2024. &ldquo;Indirectly affected 
            workers&rdquo; are those expected to have a wage rate just above the new minimum 
            wage. They are likely to receive a raise as employer pay scales are adjusted 
            upward to reflect the new minimum wage.

            <strong>Women and men of color:</strong> These categories isolate and combine 
            data for Black and Latino male and female workers.
